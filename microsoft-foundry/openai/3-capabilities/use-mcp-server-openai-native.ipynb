To include these in your model router deployment, you need to first deploy them yourself to your Foundry resource (see [Deploy and use Claude models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude?view=foundry&tabs=python)). Then enable them with [model subset configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/model-router?view=foundry) in your model router deployment.\\\\n### Model router GA version\\\\nA new model router model is now available. Version `2025-11-18` includes support for all underlying models in previous versions, as well as 10 new language models.\\\\nIt also includes new features that make it more versatile and effective.\\\\n1. **Routing profiles** let you skew model router's choices to optimize for quality or cost while maintaining a baseline level of performance.\\\\n2. Model router supports **custom subsets**: you can specify which underlying models to include in routing decisions. This gives you more control over cost, compliance, and performance characteristics.\\\\nFor more information on model router and its capabilities, see the [Model router concepts guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/model-router?view=foundry-classic).\\\", \\\"contentUrl\\\": \\\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/whats-new-model-router?view=foundry-classic\\\"}, {\\\"title\\\": \\\"Deploy and use Claude models in Microsoft Foundry (preview)\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"# Deploy and use Claude models in Microsoft Foundry (preview)\\\\n## Responsible AI considerations\\\\nWhen using Claude models in Foundry, consider these responsible AI practices:\\\\n1. Configure AI content safety during model inference, as Foundry doesn't provide built-in content filtering for Claude models at deployment time. To learn how to create and use content filters, see [Configure content filtering for Foundry Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/how-to/configure-content-filters?view=foundry-classic).\\\\n2. Ensure your applications comply with [Anthropic's Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup). Also, see details of safety evaluations for [Claude Opus 4.5](http://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-5-system-card), [Claude Haiku 4.5](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/99128ddd009bdcb/Claude-Haiku-4-5-System-Card.pdf), [Claude Opus 4.1](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/4c024b86c698d3d4/original/Claude-4-1-System-Card.pdf), and [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/12f214efcc2f457a/original/Claude-Sonnet-4-5-System-Card.pdf).\\\", \\\"contentUrl\\\": \\\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude?view=foundry-classic#responsible-ai-considerations\\\"}, {\\\"title\\\": \\\"Deploy and use Claude models in Microsoft Foundry (preview)\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"# Deploy and use Claude models in Microsoft Foundry (preview)\\\\n## Work with Claude models\\\\nOnce deployed, you have some options for interacting with Claude models to generate text responses:\\\\n1. Use the [Anthropic SDKs](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/client-sdks) and the following Claude APIs:\\\\n1.1. [Messages API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages) to send a structured list of input messages with text and/or image content, and the model generates the next message in the conversation.\\\\n1.2. [Token Count API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages-count-tokens) to count the number of tokens in a message.\\\\n1.3. [Files API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/files-create) to upload and manage files to use with the Claude API without having to re-upload content with each request.\\\\n1.4. [Skills API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills/create-skill) to create custom skills for Claude AI.\\\\n### Use the Messages API to work with Claude models\\\\nThe following examples show how to **use the Messages API** to send requests to Claude Sonnet 4.5, by using both Microsoft Entra ID authentication and API key authentication methods. To work with your deployed model, you need these items:\\\\n1. Your base URL, which is of the form `https://<resource name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic`.\\\\n2. Your target URI from your deployment details, which is of the form `https://<resource name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic/v1/messages`.\\\\n3. Microsoft Entra ID for keyless authentication or your deployment's API key for API authentication.\\\\n4. Deployment name you chose during deployment creation. This name can be different from the model ID.\\\\n**Python**\\\\n#### Use Microsoft Entra ID authentication\\\\nFor Messages API endpoints, use your base URL with Microsoft Entra ID authentication.\\\\n1. **Install the Azure Identity client library**: You need to install this library to use the `DefaultAzureCredential`. Authorization is easiest when you use `DefaultAzureCredential`, as it finds the best credential to use in its running environment.\\\\n```bash\\\\n pip install azure.identity\\\\n```\\\\n Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the Microsoft Entra ID application as environment variables: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.\\\", \\\"contentUrl\\\": \\\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude?view=foundry-classic#work-with-claude-models\\\"}, {\\\"title\\\": \\\"Anthropic Agents (programming-language-csharp)\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"# Anthropic Agents (programming-language-csharp)\\\\nThe Microsoft Agent Framework supports creating agents that use [Anthropic's Claude models](https://www.anthropic.com/claude).\\\\n## Getting Started\\\\nAdd the required NuGet packages to your project.\\\\n```powershell\\\\ndotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.Anthropic --prerelease\\\\n```\\\\nIf you're using Azure Foundry, also add:\\\\n```powershell\\\\ndotnet add package Anthropic.Foundry --prerelease\\\\ndotnet add package Azure.Identity\\\\n```\\\\n## Configuration\\\\n### Environment Variables\\\\nSet up the required environment variables for Anthropic authentication:\\\\n```powershell\\\\n# Required for Anthropic API access\\\\n$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\\\\\\\"your-anthropic-api-key\\\\\\\"\\\\n$env:ANTHROPIC_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=\\\\\\\"claude-haiku-4-5\\\\\\\"  # or your preferred model\\\\n```\\\\nYou can get an API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/).\\\\n### For Azure Foundry with API Key\\\\n```powershell\\\\n$env:ANTHROPIC_RESOURCE=\\\\\\\"your-foundry-resource-name\\\\\\\"  # Subdomain before .services.ai.azure.com\\\\n$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\\\\\\\"your-anthropic-api-key\\\\\\\"\\\\n$env:ANTHROPIC_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=\\\\\\\"claude-haiku-4-5\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n### For Azure Foundry with Azure CLI\\\\n```powershell\\\\n$env:ANTHROPIC_RESOURCE=\\\\\\\"your-foundry-resource-name\\\\\\\"  # Subdomain before .services.ai.azure.com\\\\n$env:ANTHROPIC_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=\\\\\\\"claude-haiku-4-5\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\nNote\\\\nWhen using Azure Foundry with Azure CLI, make sure you're logged in with `az login` and have access to the Azure Foundry resource.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [paid Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go) to begin.\\r\\n- Access to Microsoft Foundry with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.\\r\\n- A [Microsoft Foundry project](../../how-to/create-projects?view=foundry-classic) created in one of the supported regions: **East US2** and **Sweden Central**.\\r\\n- [Foundry Models from partners and community](../concepts/models-from-partners?view=foundry-classic) require access to **Azure Marketplace** to create subscriptions. Ensure you have the [permissions required to subscribe to model offerings](configure-marketplace?view=foundry-classic).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deploy Claude models\\r\\n\\r\\nClaude models in Foundry are available for [global standard deployment](../concepts/deployment-types?view=foundry-classic#global-standard). To deploy a Claude model, follow the instructions in [Deploy Microsoft Foundry Models in the Foundry portal](deploy-foundry-models?view=foundry-classic).\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter deployment, you can use the [Foundry playground](../../concepts/concept-playgrounds?view=foundry-classic) to interactively test the model.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Work with Claude models\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce deployed, you have some options for interacting with Claude models to generate text responses:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Use the [Anthropic SDKs](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/client-sdks) and the following Claude APIs:\\r\\n\\r\\n    - [Messages API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages) to send a structured list of input messages with text and/or image content, and the model generates the next message in the conversation.\\r\\n    - [Token Count API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages-count-tokens) to count the number of tokens in a message.\\r\\n    - [Files API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/files-create) to upload and manage files to use with the Claude API without having to re-upload content with each request.\\r\\n    - [Skills API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills/create-skill) to create custom skills for Claude AI.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Use the Messages API to work with Claude models\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following examples show how to **use the Messages API** to send requests to Claude Sonnet 4.5, by using both Microsoft Entra ID authentication and API key authentication methods. To work with your deployed model, you need these items:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Your base URL, which is of the form `https://<resource name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic`.\\r\\n- Your target URI from your deployment details, which is of the form `https://<resource name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic/v1/messages`.\\r\\n- Microsoft Entra ID for keyless authentication or your deployment's API key for API authentication.\\r\\n- Deployment name you chose during deployment creation. This name can be different from the model ID.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Python**\\r\\n#### Use Microsoft Entra ID authentication\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Messages API endpoints, use your base URL with Microsoft Entra ID authentication.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Install the Azure Identity client library**: You need to install this library to use the `DefaultAzureCredential`. Authorization is easiest when you use `DefaultAzureCredential`, as it finds the best credential to use in its running environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```bash\\r\\n    pip install azure.identity\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n    Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the Microsoft Entra ID application as environment variables: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```bash\\r\\n    export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=\\\"<AZURE_CLIENT_ID>\\\"\\r\\n    export AZURE_TENANT_ID=\\\"<AZURE_TENANT_ID>\\\"\\r\\n    export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=\\\"<AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET>\\\"\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n2. **Install dependencies:** Install the Anthropic SDK by using pip (requires: Python &gt;=3.8).\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```bash\\r\\n    pip install -U \\\"anthropic\\\"\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n3. **Run a basic code sample:** This sample completes the following tasks:\\r\\n\\r\\n    1. Creates a client with the Anthropic SDK, using Microsoft Entra ID authentication.\\r\\n    2. Makes a basic call to the Messages API. The call is synchronous.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```python\\r\\n    from anthropic import AnthropicFoundry\\r\\n    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider\\r\\n    \\r\\n    baseURL = \\\"https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic\\\" # Your base URL.

Creates a client with the Anthropic SDK by passing your API key to the SDK's configuration. This authentication method lets you interact seamlessly with the service.\\r\\n    2. Makes a basic call to the Messages API. The call is synchronous.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```python\\r\\n    from anthropic import AnthropicFoundry\\r\\n    \\r\\n    baseURL = \\\"https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic\\\" # Your base URL.
